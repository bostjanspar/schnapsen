@rules.md This is a rules used for these games.
 Please do not implement any logic in GUI, this is just for you to understand how
 the game works and layout should look like. 

@Screenshot.png This is the current view of the game.

At launching the game I get following error in the console. Take a look into the code and try to fix it. 

Let's create new scene: 
Select the dealer. 
In the middle of the screen where is a talun  display provided card from game logic

if it's a red then the player 1 dealer if a black suit then the player 2 is the dealer.
 Make some arrow animation if the player one make some arrow down animation  if it's a.
Player two dealer make an arrow up animation.




Use Context7 mcp to verify Three.js documentation  if  Three.js is used correctly and its best practice . Also update  @CLAUDE.md to use Context7 mcp for external documentation


@src/app/gui/scenes/game
@src/app/logic/game-logic.ts
I would need to plan how can game scene access game logic member variables like deck,playerHand,opponentHand. so i do not have to pass it over @src/app/gui/scenes/gui-controller.ts  , .
 But I definitely want to have it only read only  access game logic variables . Game scene should never be allowed to change anything on game logic side.
How could be the best way to achieve this? 
But it never reacts by itself when some of the game logic member variable changes. I will call it over the control class gui-controller.ts. 


Go through the code  of @src/app/gui/scenes/game and in @file src/app/gui/scenes/game/game.scene.ts implement to show talun and trumpCard under it.  display it as part of dealNewCards game.scene.ts
