@rules.md This is a rules used for these games.
 Please do not implement any logic in GUI, this is just for you to understand how
 the game works and layout should look like. 

@Screenshot.png This is the current view of the game.

At launching the game I get following error in the console. Take a look into the code and try to fix it. 


Create new folder logic next to sm folder. That will contain all game logic needed for this game.
 Look into the rules and see all the logic that is required for this game. 
Then create root state machine for a  seven game points
 

 first for the whole game. And then for each game that is being played and then still sub state for each three game where we will always check which card can be played and what should be done and you will communicate or state changes to game state machine.
