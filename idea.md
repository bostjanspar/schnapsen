# The Idea of the Game
Schnapsen is a point-trick game of the Marriage group, where the goal is to win points by capturing valuable cards in tricks and making bonuses by melding marriages (matched pairs of kings and queens). Schnapsen stands out due to several unique features:

- The game is played at trick-and-draw, with no requirement to follow suit until the talon (undealt cards) is exhausted or closed. After that, tricks are played strictly, following suit, trumping, and heading the trick when required.
- To win a hand, a player needs 66 card points, and players must keep track of their scores mentally—no scoresheets are allowed. If a player reaches 66 but fails to announce it, the opponent can claim victory upon reaching 66, regardless of the actual scores. Incorrectly claiming 66 results in a penalty.
- A game is played to seven game points, which can be reached quickly due to penalties and bonuses.
- The short pack means every card is important, and strategic decisions are crucial. Closing the talon is a key element of strategy.

A typical game proceeds as follows: hands are dealt, one undealt card is turned up as trump, and players play at trick-and-draw, aiming to build strength (often in trumps) to close the talon. Players also look for valuable melds (marriages and the trump Jack, which can be swapped for the turn-up trump) that can quickly swing the hand. Throughout, both players track their own and their opponent's scores. At some point, a player may close the talon, after which cards are played out strictly. Usually, one player draws trumps and announces 66 before the hand ends, but an incorrect call gives the opponent a big bonus.

## The Cards

Schnapsen is played with a 20-card French- or German-suited pack. Austrian Schnapsen packs have 24 cards (as for Sechsundsechzig); remove the Nines before playing. With a standard 52-card pack, remove cards from Two to Nine inclusive.

The ranks and values of the cards are:

| French suited card | German suited card      | Point value |
|--------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Ace (Ass)          | Deuce / Sow (Daus/Sau) | 11          |
| Ten (Zehner)       | Ten (Zehner)           | 10          |
| King (König)       | King (König)           | 4           |
| Queen (Dame)       | Over (Ober)            | 3           |
| Jack (Bube)        | Under (Unter)          | 2           |

With German cards, the highest card is in fact the two (Daus), although it is sometimes called the ace (Ass), and often the Sow (Sau), since it is a fat card, worth many points. Note also that, in the absence of a queen, same-sex marriages are between the König and Ober. In fact Obers are sometimes referred to as Queens (Damen) and Unters as Jacks (Buben).
## The Deal

To determine the dealer, use any mutually agreed method (such as drawing for high card or flipping a coin). After the first deal, the role of dealer alternates between the players.

1. **Shuffling and Cutting:** The dealer shuffles the deck and offers it to the opponent to cut.
2. **Dealing:** The dealer deals three cards to each player, one at a time. Then, the next card is placed face up on the table to indicate the trump suit.
3. **Completing the Hands:** The dealer then deals two more cards to each player, so that each player has five cards in hand.
4. **Forming the Talon:** The remaining ten cards are stacked face down crosswise on top of the trump indicator card, leaving the trump visible. This stack is called the talon. Players will draw from the talon after each trick until it is exhausted or closed.

This setup ensures both players have five cards, a visible trump, and a talon to draw from during the first phase of play.
Determine the dealer by any acceptable means; thereafter, the deal alternates between the players. After the shuffle and cut, deal a batch of three cards to each player. The next card is placed face up on the table to determine the trump suit. Then another batch of two cards is dealt to each player, so that the players have five cards each. Finally the remaining undealt cards are stacked face down crosswise on top of the trump, so that the value of the trump card can still be seen. These ten cards form the talon, from which the players draw after each trick.

The Play
Non-dealer leads to the first trick. In the first part of the hand, a trick is taken by the highest card of the suit led, or by the highest trump if any is played. There is no obligation to follow suit or to trump. The trick is taken by the winner, who will count the point value of the two cards in the trick, as per the table above, towards the total of 66 needed to win the hand. After the trick is played, the winner of the trick takes the top card of the talon to replenish her hand, after which the loser does the same. The winner of the trick leads to the next.

In informal ("soft") games, it is legal for a player to look through the cards in the tricks that she has taken. However, when a trick is won by an opponent, you are only allowed to see it until the first card is played to the next trick.

The Trump Jack
As in many Central European Ace-Ten games, the holder of the lowest trump card (in this case the Jack) may exchange it for the trump turn-up. This can only be done by the player whose turn it is to lead, just before he leads to the trick. The exchange does not have to be made at the first possible opportunity - the holder of the trump jack can wait and exchange after any trick that he wins, as long as cards still remain in the talon, and the talon has not been closed. Once the talon has been closed or exhausted, the trump jack cannot be exchanged.

Marriages / Pairs
A "marriage" or "pair" (the matched King and Queen, or King and Ober, of any suit) may be melded at the start of any trick by the player whose turn it is to lead. This scores 20 points (for a plain marriage) or 40 points (for a royal marriage, i.e., a marriage in trumps). The player declares "20" or "40" and must lead one of the two cards to the trick and show the other card. Although a marriage can be melded any time that a player has the lead, the score does not count until the melder has taken a trick. So for example, a player may declare 40 for the King-Queen of trumps on the opening lead, but if she doesn't take a trick by the end of the hand her score is zero.

Exhausting the Talon
If no one closes, eventually the last two cards of the talon are drawn - the last face-down card goes to the winner of this trick and the face-up trump to the loser. After this the rules of play change and become more strict. Players must follow suit; also, subject to the requirement to follow suit the second player must beat the led card if possible. This means that if your opponent leads a non-trump:

you must play a higher card of the same suit if you can;
failing this you must play a lower card of the same suit;
if you have no card of the suit that was led you must play a trump;
if you have no trumps either you may play anything.
If your opponent leads a trump:

you must play a higher trump if possible;
if you have no higher trump you must play a lower trump;
if you have no trumps at all you may play anything.
Closing
At any point, when it is her turn to lead, either player may close the talon, by flipping over the trump turn-up and placing it face-down on the top of the talon. This is an undertaking to reach at least 66 card points using only the cards in one's hand. After the talon is closed, no more cards can be drawn from it, and the remaining cards are played according to the same rules as when the talon is exhausted: follow suit and head the trick if possible, otherwise trump.

The talon can only be closed after drawing a replacement card, when the players have hands of five cards each. It is possible to exchange the trump Jack for the trump indicator card and then also close the talon before leading to the next trick.

Note that in Schnapsen, unlike the German game 66, it is still possible to meld a marriage when leading to a trick, even after the talon has been closed. Therefore a non-dealer who is dealt the Ace, King and Queen of trumps can do the following: close the talon, lead the Ace, then declare 40 and lead the King followed by the Queen. The opponent cannot have more than one trump (one is in the talon), so this will win unless the opponent is able to put fewer than 8 card points on these three tricks, and then win the remaining two tricks.

Going Out
A player who believes she has 66 or more points can declare this fact, claiming to have won the hand. Play ceases immediately. A claim may be made just after winning a trick or just after declaring a marriage, but not at any other time.

At this point there are two possibilities: the player claiming to be out is right, or she is wrong. If she is right, she scores points toward game as follows:

one game point, if the opponent has made at least 33 points;
two game points, if the opponent has made fewer than 33 points, but has won at least one trick (opponent is said to be Schneider);
three game points, if the opponent has won no tricks (opponent is said to be Schwarz).
If she is wrong, the opponent scores 2 game points, or 3 game points if the false claim is made before the opponent has taken a trick.

When a player closes the talon, reaches 66 points and goes out, the score is based on the tricks and points that the opponent had at the moment when the talon was closed: 1 game point if the opponent had 33 or more card points, 2 if the opponent had at least one trick but fewer than 33 points, and 3 if the talon was closed before the opponent won a trick. (This method of scoring is called Viennese closing (Wienerisch Zudrehen) or dark closing (Zudrehen finster).)

If a player closes and subsequently fails to reach 66 and go out, the penalty is 2 points to the opponent, or 3 if the opponent had no tricks when the talon was closed. These scores apply however few card points the opponent has taken. Note that it is not possible to go out after losing a trick. Therefore, if a player closes and plays on to the last card, but loses the last trick, his opponent automatically wins because the closing player cannot go out at this point, even if it turns out that he actually had 66 or more points.

The same scores of 2 or 3 game points apply in the unusual case where the opponent of the player who closed reaches 66 and wins by claiming first, before the closing player has gone out.

If neither player closed the talon and neither went out, i.e., play continued to the very last trick with the talon exhausted, the player who takes the last trick wins the hand, scoring one game point, irrespective of the number of card points the players have taken.

To determine the correctness of a claim, both players' points are counted up by going through the cards won in tricks and adding 20's and 40's for declared marriages, though if both players agree on each other's scores this step can be skipped. (It's no insult to ask for the points to be counted.)

When settling a claim, it may sometimes turn out that the player who did not claim actually had 66 or more points. This does not affect the score - so long as the claim was correct, the claiming player wins, however many points the opponent had. The opponent should have kept better track of the score and claimed earlier.

Scoring
Both players start with 7 game points, and subtract the game points they win. The overall winner is the first player whose score reaches or passes zero.

Comments on Strategy
Nearly every card in Schnapsen counts. There's almost no deadwood, so you have to think carefully about what you want to do with each card. Aces and Tens are worth a lot of points, but you can't safely lead them in the first half because your opponent is likely to trump them. You want to hold on to Kings and Queens because of the potential for marriages, but of course your opponent is probably holding the mates so you will need to discard them eventually. This leaves only three Jacks that you can throw off to tricks without pain (the trump Jack you probably want to keep for the exchange). Of course you'll be forced to break these rules on occasion. You might pull trump with Aces or Tens when holding a long non-trump suit. It can be advantageous to not have the lead in the first half, so that you can win tricks with Tens and Aces to gain points, but you need to be able to get the lead back in order to meld marriages. But there are so few cards in your hand, and the talon runs out so quickly, that you usually can't manage to make plans like these work.

Closing at the right time is the key tactic of the game. You need to count your points, and always keep a count of the sure points that you could win if you closed, along with the average points you'd gain from your opponent. The minute you have a sure (or likely) 66, you should close and rake in your game points. You also need to count your opponent's points, so that you can change your strategy when you think she's about to close (quickly using your trump to be sure to cross the Rubicon of 33 points, for example). A risky close might be indicated if your opponent can be made Schneider or Schwarz.

Don't be put off your stride by a few bad hands; Schnapsen allows exciting come-from-behind wins. There's nothing like winning the game after your opponent is ahead 1-7!


Addtioal rules 
The talon cannot be closed when only two cards remain in it (the face up trump and one face down card).

A marriage or pair cannnot be declared until the player has won a trick. Therefore the non-dealer cannot declare one when leading to the first trick.
